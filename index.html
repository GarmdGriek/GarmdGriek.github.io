                        <div class="post-content">
                            <p>Time still flies by</p>
                            <p>As you may have noticed, the site has moved to Github. I have invested some time in learning and deploying on github as it is faster then my 8 year old Qnap and also likely more stabile.</p>
                            <p>There has been alot of stuff going on at work. Dell launched a new product called Objectscale to compliment the rebranding of the unstructured portfolio.<br>
                            How do I feel about the new names and the Isilon name being retired? <br>
                            For OneFS products (Isilon and powerscale) its not a good or bad feeling. It is a good feeling to move forward and be included in the Power portfolio, with better then ever products. 
                            It is also not a removial of Isilon, Gen5&6 models are still Isilon and it will be with us for several years. Dell got 2 powerscale nodes and 8 Isilon nodes right now. Some Isilon nodes launched in the last 12 months. 
                            I am a bit sentimental about it though, Isilon is why i Joined EMC back in the da, but it ends there Powerscale still runs OneFS and the productline is stronger then ever.</p>
                            <p>Objectscale is different. I never had strong feeling around the name Elastic cloud storage. It sounds like a description. Also I am not right now convinced about the Objectscale name. It kind of alligns with
                            Powerscale, but does it really make sense? Would Powerobject make more sense? or my favorite for the title Powerscale - Object. That would truly show 2 unstrucvtured products in family, but solving
                            different tasks. Then again I did not like Powerscale either when I first heard it. It's just a name. However for Objectscale there is more to it. Objectscale is a Vmware container based objectstorage
                            it ties closely into the vmware fabric so to speak. It can start as small as you want, even in a community edition for testing and then grow without limits. This can be run on any server, meaning it can easily be
                            deployed globally. Small office. large offices, oil wells, 5g towers all with local access to a global repository of object data. It's exiting :)</p>
                            <p>I will write a seperate piece on Objectscale and how it integrates with Vmware at a later date. <a href="https://blog.dellemc.com/en-us/dell-emc-objectscale-early-access-on-vmware-cloud-foundation/">for now you can read more about it @dell.com</a>

                        Vacation is over and as usual July is not the best of months in Norway, lot's of rain and coolish weather, hardly ever above 20. We did have a nice vacation though, or staycation as some call it.
                    We spent roughly 3 of the 4 weeks put at home. <a href="/blogpost/20200813-back-to-work.html">(READ MORE...)</a></p>
