                        <div class="post-content">
                        <p> So I have to admit something first of all. I am not really good at being consequent on my posting. I am far behind on the things I need to write about. Coding has grinded to a halt.
                            I still have a million things... well not million. but quite a few things I want to code into this site. logon with proper authentication, not the workaround that is there today. fortunatly it protects nothing
                            php, database connection. forum possibility. and so on. the complete list can be found <a href="/blogpost/20200703-website-plans.html">HERE</a> I do however really appreicate that people stop by to read this. If you are 
                            one of those that do read it and have some comments to it, then please reachout to me by <a href="mailto:nicolai.imset@gmail.com?subject=blogFeedback" target="_blank">mail</a>. I will try to answer everyone
                            and if the discussion is noteworthy. I will (if permission is given) post it in a readable format here. Which I honestly have n oclue what will look like yet. I do thank you for reading and hope to see you in a proper forum here soon.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have also started walking, which is one of the reasons coding is falling behind. I am getting 10 000 steps pr day, up from 2500-3500 and try to get 20 000 steps three times a week, walking 20 000 steps takes me roughly 3 hours.
                            And I cover nearly 20 kilometres doing it. I do enjoy it alot, but am looking for ways for it to be incorporated to the hours in front of the desk. Seems there are both threadmills and stationary bike options. Any thoughts on what is best?
                            Or if anyone know of a brand that delivers to private people and are designed to fit my 197cm / 110+ kg.
                        </p>
                        <p><h4>Honest Appreciation</h4>
                        I have been listening to "How to win friends and influence people" by Dale Carnegie the last period while walking, unless I am talking to someone on the phone. This honest appreciation struck a chord with me.
                        I do like the mindset of appreciating people. Too often today we find ourselves asking or demanding something and many often even don't say please or thank you for it. It's all assumed to be unnessecary when someone "only" does their job.
                        </p>
                        <p>As an experiment I started using honest appreciation on my daughters tasks at home, while trying at times, I could see from the first time that she appreciated it. The first time she had completed one of two tasks due, admitedly the larger task she did
                        and forgot the smaller far simpler task. I told her how pleased i was with the performance on the larger task, it was easy, she had done a good job. Also I did not mention the other task that she had forgotten. First message I got back was an appology and the she
                        would do the other task once she was home from school. Previous situation where I have snet her a message saying you forgot to do XYZ has caused frustration for all of us. This being said it's easy to give her honest, sincere appreciation as she is a good teenager (fortunatly)</p>
                        <p>I beleive the book has changed my way of writing and thinking, I have listened to it 2 1/4 time and the messages is sinking in. Think I need to read it as well</p>
                        <p>try adding some sincere, honest appreciation to the people around you. I'll make the assumption they are around you for a reason and they as well as I and likely you want to be appreciated. Some ideas on how to do This
                            <ol>
                                <li>Clear your mind</li>
                                <li>Think through the person and/or action that you want to show appreciation for</li>
                                <li>Find positives and focus on these</li>
                                <li>Congratulate the person on what was well done, don't include what was dissapointing (if anything)</li>
                                <li>Do not mention any negatives, buts or dissatisfactions</li>
                            </ol>
                        Most likely the person will find out what was wrong or not satisfactory and remedy it. It's a tried and tested method and works everytime if applied as stated. This system will over time lead to behavior you want to see. positive reinforcement is a great tool.
                        That being said it's nothing wrog in giving constructive criticism, but be careful. IT should not be used often and with the greates care.</p>
                        <p>Some homework. next time you need to use "but" try to use "and" instead. It is also a very powerful tool. "But" cancels everything said before but, and includes it</p>
                        <p>Take care, stay safe</p>
